Description: A package of tools for using null models to analyse ecological
    networks (e.g. food webs, flower-visitation networks, seed-dispersal
    networks) and detect resource preferences or non-random interactions among
    network nodes. Tools are provided to run null models, test for and plot
    preferences, plot and analyse bipartite networks, and export null model
    results in a form compatible with other network analysis packages.
