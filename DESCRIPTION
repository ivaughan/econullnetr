Description: Tools for using null models to analyse ecological
    networks (e.g. food webs, flower-visitation networks, seed-dispersal
    networks) and detect resource preferences or non-random interactions among
    network nodes. Tools are provided to run null models, test for and plot
    preferences, plot and analyse bipartite networks, and export null model
    results in a form compatible with other network analysis packages. The 
    underlying null model was developed by Agusti et al. (2003) 
    <doi:10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.02014.x> and the full application to 
    ecological networks by Vaughan et al. (2017) econullnetr: an R package 
    using null models to analyse the structure of ecological networks and 
    identify resource selection. Methods in Ecology & Evolution, in press.
