Description: Null models to analyse ecological networks (e.g. food webs, 
    flower-visitation networks, seed-dispersal networks) and detect resource 
    preferences or non-random interactions among network nodes. Tools are 
    provided to run null models, test for and plot preferences, plot and 
    analyse bipartite networks, and export null model results in a form 
    compatible with other network analysis packages. The underlying null model 
    was developed by Agusti et al. (2003) Molecular Ecology 
    <doi:10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.02014.x> and the full application to 
    ecological networks by Vaughan et al. (2018) econullnetr: an R package 
    using null models to analyse the structure of ecological networks and 
    identify resource selection. Methods in Ecology & Evolution, 
    <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12907>.
