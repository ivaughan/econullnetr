\title{Flower visitation network from an arable field in the UK}
\format{A data frame with 128 rows and seven columns, one row for each individual
  pollinator. The first column (\code{Visit}) represents the sampling occasion
  on which the pollinator was collected (V1--V11), the second column
  (\code{Insect}) represents the flower visitor taxon, and the remaining five
  columns are the five flower species, which were either visited (1) or not (0)
  by each insect.}

\description{
A flower visitation network from an arable field site in the UK, notable for
 the presence of small-flowered catchfly \emph{Silene gallica}, a rare arable
 weed species in the UK.  Flower visitors and floral abundance were sampled on
 11 occasions in the summer of 2002, with all insect flower visitors (31 taxa)
 recorded on the flower species where they were observed. Gibson \emph{et al}.
 (2006) provide full details of the data and analysis of the results.
